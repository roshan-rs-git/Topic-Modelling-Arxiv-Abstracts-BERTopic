    "abstract": "  A major task for moderators of online spaces is norm-setting, essentially\ncreating shared norms for user behavior in their communities. Platform design\nprinciples emphasize the importance of highlighting norm-adhering examples and\nexplicitly stating community norms. However, norms and values vary between\ncommunities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for\nplatforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable\nbehavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches to detect desirability\nare limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these\nmeasures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper,\nwe use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability\nand examine 16,000 highly-upvoted comments across 80 popular sub-communities on\nReddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments\nacross two years (2016 and 2022) and compile 64 and 72 $\\textit{macro}$,\n$\\textit{meso}$, and $\\textit{micro}$ values for 2016 and 2022 respectively,\nbased on their frequency across communities. Furthermore, we find that existing\ncomputational models for measuring prosociality were inadequate to capture on\naverage $82\\%$ of the values we extracted. Finally, we show that our approach\ncan not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior\ntaxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in\npractice. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced models of desirability\nthat go beyond preexisting prosocial measures. This work has implications for\nimproving moderator understanding of their community values and provides a\nframework that can supplement qualitative approaches with larger-scale content\nanalyses.\n",

    "abstract": "  Optimization-based controllers, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC), have\nattracted significant research interest due to their intuitive concept,\nconstraint handling capabilities, and natural application to multi-input\nmulti-output systems. However, the computational complexity of solving a\nreceding horizon problem at each time step remains a challenge for the\ndeployment of MPC. This is particularly the case for systems constrained by\nmany inequalities. Recently, we introduced the concept of constraint-adaptive\nMPC (ca-MPC) to address this challenge for linear systems with hard\nconstraints. In ca-MPC, at each time step, a subset of the constraints is\nremoved from the optimization problem, thereby accelerating the optimization\nprocedure, while resulting in identical closed-loop behavior. The present paper\nextends this framework to soft-constrained MPC by detecting and removing\nconstraints based on sub-optimal predicted input sequences, which is rather\neasy for soft-constrained MPC due to the receding horizon principle and the\ninclusion of slack variables. We will translate these new ideas explicitly to\nan offset-free output tracking problem. The effectiveness of these ideas is\ndemonstrated on a two-dimensional thermal transport model, showing a three\norder of magnitude improvement in online computational time of the MPC scheme.\n",

    "abstract": "  All-in-one image restoration has emerged as a practical and promising\nlow-level vision task for real-world applications. In this context, the key\nissue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images\nsimultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware\nResidual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models\n(all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for\nunpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a\ndegradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map.\nSpecifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT\nobjective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier\nresidual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for\nrestoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is\ncomputed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings\nto condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects\nintrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and\nstructural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT\nmap, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one\nrestoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the\nfavorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in\nterms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure\npreservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world\nscenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to\nboth degradation levels and the number of degradations.\n",

Prior research\nsuggests that aesthetic and affective attractiveness in pictures enhances\nenjoyment and engagement with the physics content. This paper offers three main\ncontributions: Firstly, it conceptualizes and presents research-based criteria\nfor selecting pictures perceived as aesthetically pleasing, drawing on insights\nfrom psychology and physics education research.

    "abstract": "  We provide a formulation and proof of the gravitational entropy bound. We use\na recently given framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a\nquantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If\nthis framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a\nhypersurface $\\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without\nboundary contained in $\\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. We\nshow here that this submanifold is naturally restricted to obey an entropy\nbound if the field theory is diffeomorphism-invariant. We prove this\nrestriction to arise by considering the quantum-mechanical sum of paths in\nphase space and exploiting the interplay of the commutativity of the sum with\ndiffeomorphism-invariance. The formulation of the entropy bound, which we state\nand derive in detail, involves a functional $K$ on the submanifold associated\nto $B.$ We give an explicit construction of $K$ in terms of the Lagrangian. The\ngravitational entropy bound then states: For any real $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar},$\nconsider the set of states where $K$ takes a value not bigger than $\\lambda$\nand let $V$ denote the phase space volume of this set. One has then $\\ln (V)\n\\le \\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar}.$ Especially, we show for the Einstein-Hilbert\nLagrangian in any dimension with cosmological constant and arbitrary minimally\ncoupled matter, one has $K = \\frac{A}{4G}.$ Hereby, $A$ denotes the area of $B$\nin a particular state.\n",

To address these challenges, this work\nintroduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for\nautonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural\nenvironments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry\nalgorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping\nmodule that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for\nselective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to\nprioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted\npoints and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in\nodometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art\nmethods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments\nfeaturing various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles.\nResults demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation\nand mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural\nsettings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and\naccumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational\nefficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods.

By merging two\ncatalogues, one containing 10,535 lithium-rich giant stars with lithium\nabundances ranging from 1.5 to 4.9 dex, and the other detecting infrared\nsources, we have found 421 clump giant stars and 196 first-ascending giant\nstars with infrared excesses indicating stellar mass losses. The clump stars\nare the most lithium-rich. Approximately 5.8 percent of these stars\nepisodically lose mass in periods of approximately 10^4 years or less, while\nthe remaining stars ceased their mass loss and maintained their lithium for\nnearly 10^7 years. We propose a scenario in which all giant stars with masses\nbelow two solar masses undergo prompt lithium enrichment with mass-ejection\nepisodes. We suggest that mass loss results from internal angular-momentum\ntransport. It is possible that a transitory instability, perhaps of magnetic\norigin, rapidly transports the nuclear material responsible for the lithium\nenrichment to the stellar surface and triggers shell ejections. Additionally,\nthe strong mass loss in some lithium-rich stars during their evolution\nactivates their chromospheres, as observed in ultraviolet spectra. Furthermore,\nintense episodical mass losses in these stages led to the observable formation\nof complex organic and inorganic particles, as detected in near-infrared\nspectra. In contrast to first-ascending giant stars, helium flashes during the\nclump can contribute to additional lithium enrichment alongside the\naforementioned process.

    "abstract": "  DNA has been proposed as a chemical platform for computing and data storage,\npaving the way for building DNA-based computers. Recently, DNA has been\nhypothesized as an ideal quantum computer with the base pairs working as\nJosephson junctions. There are still major challenges to be overcome in these\ndirections, but they do not prevent deviceful perspectives of the main problem.\nThe present paper explores DNA base pairs as elementary units for a scalable\nnuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer (NMRQC). First, it presents an\noverview of the proton transfer (PT) mechanism during the prototropic\ntautomerism in the base pairs, scoring the current stage. Second, as a\nproof-of-principle, the paper examines these molecular structures as quantum\nprocessing units (QPUs) of a biochemical quantum device. For the model proposed\nhere, it is theoretically demonstrated that the nuclear spins involved in the\nPT of base pairs can be deterministically prepared in a superposition of\ntriplet states. Under appropriate conditions, the proton dynamics provides the\nminimal two-qubit entanglement required for quantum computing. The dynamics\nbetween the canonical and tautomeric quantum states (CQS and TQS, respectively)\nis determined from a thermally dependent Watson-Crick quantum superposition\n(WCQS); i.e., |WCQS> = a(T)|CQS> + b(T)|TQS> with |a(T)|^2 + |b(T)|^2 = 1. If\nthe DNA structure is sufficiently protected to avoid environment-induced\ndecoherence of the confined-proton quantum states, quantum information can be\nsuccessfully encoded in several base pairs along the coiled double strand. As a\npotential applicability, a crystalline DNA device could be employed for quantum\ncomputing and cryptography controlled by a sequence of Ramsey pulses. Finally,\nthis study critically evaluates these possibilities toward a proof-of-concept\nof a DNA-based quantum computer.\n",

UG-CEMT leverages the strengths of\nco-training and knowledge distillation by combining a Cross-attention Ensemble\nMean Teacher framework (CEMT) inspired by Vision Transformers (ViT) with\nuncertainty-guided consistency regularization and Sharpness-Aware Minimization\nemphasizing uncertainty. UG-CEMT improves semi-supervised performance while\nmaintaining a consistent network architecture and task setting by fostering\nhigh disparity between sub-networks. Experiments demonstrate significant\nadvantages over existing methods like Mean Teacher and Cross-pseudo Supervision\nin terms of disparity, domain generalization, and medical image segmentation\nperformance. UG-CEMT achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-center prostate\nMRI and cardiac MRI datasets, where object segmentation is particularly\nchallenging. Our results show that using only 10\\% labeled data, UG-CEMT\napproaches the performance of fully supervised methods, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in exploiting unlabeled data for robust medical image\nsegmentation.

The dataset presented\nhere confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50\nand 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is\nfound to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less\nspherical.

The test generator NEATEST tackles these challenges by\ncombining search-based software testing principles with neuroevolution to\noptimise neural networks that serve as test cases. However, since NEATEST is\ndesigned as a single-objective algorithm, it may require a long time to cover\nfairly simple program states or may even get stuck trying to reach unreachable\nprogram states. In order to resolve these shortcomings of NEATEST, this work\naims to transform the algorithm into a many-objective search algorithm that\ntargets several program states simultaneously. To this end, we combine the\nneuroevolution algorithm NEATEST with the two established search-based software\ntesting algorithms, MIO and MOSA. Moreover, we adapt the existing\nmany-objective neuroevolution algorithm NEWS/D to serve as a test generator.\nOur experiments on a dataset of 20 SCRATCH programs show that extending NEATEST\nto target several objectives simultaneously increases the average branch\ncoverage from 75.88% to 81.33% while reducing the required search time by\n93.28%.\n",

    "abstract": "  While attention-based models have demonstrated the remarkable ability of\nin-context learning, the theoretical understanding of how these models acquired\nthis ability through gradient descent training is still preliminary. Towards\nanswering this question, we study the gradient descent dynamics of multi-head\nlinear self-attention trained for in-context linear regression. We examine two\nparametrizations of linear self-attention: one with the key and query weights\nmerged as a single matrix (common in theoretical studies), and one with\nseparate key and query matrices (closer to practical settings). For the merged\nparametrization, we show the training dynamics has two fixed points and the\nloss trajectory exhibits a single, abrupt drop. We derive an analytical\ntime-course solution for a certain class of datasets and initialization. For\nthe separate parametrization, we show the training dynamics has exponentially\nmany fixed points and the loss exhibits saddle-to-saddle dynamics, which we\nreduce to scalar ordinary differential equations. During training, the model\nimplements principal component regression in context with the number of\nprincipal components increasing over training time. Overall, we characterize\nhow in-context learning abilities evolve during gradient descent training of\nlinear attention, revealing dynamics of abrupt acquisition versus progressive\nimprovements in models with different parametrizations.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund\n1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we\nmeasure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic\nmemberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After\ncorrecting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density\ndistribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of\n$0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the\nradial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in\nthe core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass\nsegregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation\nratio of $\\Lambda_\\mathrm{\\rm MSR}=1.11\\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\\sigma$,\nand slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The\ncluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \\pm\n0.10~\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial\nstate implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or\ninefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach\nthe cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$\nGyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation\nfor stars more massive than $10~M_\\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass\nsegregation found in the mass range of $1.00\\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\\odot$ in\nthis work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not\nprimordial.\n",

However, nowadays, it is still\npresent in the troposphere. This is due to plutonium-bearing soil particles\nphysical resuspension processes. In this work, we study for the first time the\ntemporal variation of plutonium isotopes, 239Pu and 240Pu, baseline\nconcentrations on a monthly basis in surface air from Seville (Spain), and\ntheir correlation with some tracers of mineral dust, during 2001 and 2002. The\nPu analyses were performed by low-energy Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS).\nThe 239Pu plus 240Pu (239+240Pu) activity levels achieved maximums during the\nsummer period, characterized by the absence of rains, and minimums during the\nrainy seasons, laying in the range 1-20 nBq per cubic meter. The 240Pu/239Pu\ntwo-year average atomic ratio was 0.18(0.03), in agreement with the fallout\nplutonium. A good correlation with Pu and Al and Ti levels is observed. They\nare crustal components usually used as tracers of African dust over European\ncountries.

To improve client-specific performance,\npersonalization via the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) modules\nsuch as LoRA is common. This involves a personalization strategy (PS), such as\nthe design of the PEFT adapter structures (e.g., in which layers to add LoRAs\nand what ranks) and choice of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rates) for\nfine-tuning. Instead of manual PS configuration, we propose FedP$^2$EFT, a\nfederated learning-to-personalize method for multilingual LLMs in cross-device\nFL settings. Unlike most existing PEFT structure selection methods, which are\nprone to overfitting low-data regimes, FedP$^2$EFT collaboratively learns the\noptimal personalized PEFT structure for each client via Bayesian sparse rank\nselection.

However, the\nchallenge lies in converting the LLM-generated outputs into reasonable and\nphysically feasible scene layouts. In this paper, we propose to generate\nhierarchically structured scene descriptions with LLM and then compute the\nscene layouts. Specifically, we train a hierarchy-aware network to infer the\nfine-grained relative positions between objects and design a divide-and-conquer\noptimization to solve for scene layouts. The advantages of using hierarchically\nstructured scene representation are two-fold. First, the hierarchical structure\nprovides a rough grounding for object arrangement, which alleviates\ncontradictory placements with dense relations and enhances the generalization\nability of the network to infer fine-grained placements. Second, it naturally\nsupports the divide-and-conquer optimization, by first arranging the sub-scenes\nand then the entire scene, to more effectively solve for a feasible layout. We\nconduct extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies with both\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations to validate the effectiveness of our\nkey designs with the hierarchically structured scene representation. Our\napproach can generate more reasonable scene layouts while better aligned with\nthe user requirements and LLM descriptions.

VCES uses a nodal\nactive set indicator function as the initial iterate to a time-dependent heat\nequation problem. Solving a single step of this problem has the effect of\nsmoothing the indicator about the free boundary. We threshold this smoothed\nindicator function to identify elements near the free boundary. Key parameters\nsuch as timestep and threshold values significantly influence the efficacy of\nthis method.\n  The second strategy, UDO, focuses on the discrete identification of elements\nadjacent to the free boundary, employing a graph-based approach to mark\nneighboring elements for refinement.

    "abstract": "  Blind source separation (BSS) refers to the process of recovering multiple\nsource signals from observations recorded by an array of sensors. Common\napproaches to BSS, including independent vector analysis (IVA), and independent\nlow-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), typically rely on second-order models to\ncapture the statistical independence of source signals for separation. However,\nthese methods generally do not account for the implicit structural information\nacross frequency bands, which may lead to model mismatches between the assumed\nsource distributions and the distributions of the separated source signals\nestimated from the observed mixtures. To tackle these limitations, this paper\nshows that conventional approaches such as IVA and ILRMA can easily be\nleveraged by the Sinkhorn divergence, incorporating an optimal transport (OT)\nframework to adaptively correct source variance estimates. This allows for the\nrecovery of the source distribution while modeling the inter-band signal\ndependence and reallocating source power across bands. As a result, enhanced\nversions of these algorithms are developed, integrating a Sinkhorn iterative\nscheme into their standard implementations. Extensive simulations demonstrate\nthat the proposed methods consistently enhance BSS performance.\n",

Additionally, we extend\nTS-WPM to support cooperative localization by leveraging two-way\ntime-of-arrival (TW-TOA) measurements, which enhances positioning accuracy in\nscenarios with limited anchor availability. To analyze TS-WPM, we derive its\nerror covariance matrix and mean squared error (MSE), establishing conditions\nfor its optimality and robustness.

This work is motivated\nby the requirement in constrained random verification (CRV) to generate input\nstimuli to validate the functionality of digital hardware circuits. A major\nchallenge in CRV is generating inputs for sequential circuits, along with the\nappropriate number of clock cycles required to meet design constraints.\nTraditional approaches often use Boolean satisfiability (SAT) samplers to\ngenerate inputs by unrolling state transitions over a fixed number of clock\ncycles. However, these methods do not guarantee that a solution exists for the\ngiven number of cycles. Consequently, producing input stimuli together with the\nrequired clock cycles is essential for thorough testing and verification. Our\napproach converts the logical constraints and temporal behavior of sequential\ncircuits into a recurrent CircuitSAT problem, optimized via gradient descent to\nefficiently explore a diverse set of valid solutions, including their\nassociated number of clock cycles. By operating directly on the circuit\nstructure, our method reinterprets the sampling process as a supervised\nmulti-output regression task. This differentiable framework enables independent\nelement-wise operations on each tensor element, facilitating parallel execution\nduring learning. As a result, we achieve GPU-accelerated sampling with\nsubstantial runtime improvements (up to 105.1x) over state-of-the-art heuristic\nsamplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive\nevaluations on circuit problems from the ISCAS-89 and ITC'99 benchmark suites.\n",

    "abstract": "  Non-reciprocal critical currents without applying an external magnetic field\nhave been observed recently in several superconductors, in various forms of\nGraphene, a Kagome compound and in an under-doped cuprate. A necessary\nrequirement for this is that the usual supercurrent be accompanied by a chiral\nsuper-current, i.e. with the symmetry of a hall current; equivalently that the\nsuperfluid density tensor have a chiral component. It also requires inversion\nbreaking. The conditions for this phenomena are derived to find that their\nnormal states must break time-reversal and chirality and that the\nsuperconducting states must in addition be non-unitary. Each of the\nsuperconductors where spontaneous non-reciprocal critical currents are observed\nhave shown some evidence for such broken symmetries in the normal state. The\nsuperconducting state of such materials have topological edge currents, but\ntheir projected electro-magnetic part is in general not an integer. The edge\nstates are protected in the superconductor due to a gap. Under ideal\nconditions, the normal state should show an anomalous Hall effect.\n",

Therefore, a main challenge is\ndetermining how to integrate graph data, which contains structural and spatial\ninformation about molecules, with text data. In addition, simply using both 1D\nSMILES text and 2D graph as inputs without addressing how they align and\nrepresent the molecule structure in different modalities makes it challenging\nto fully utilize structural knowledge about molecules.

While there exist\nmany powerful methods for designing dynamically corrected gates, they typically\ninvolve an exploration across a large-dimensional landscape filled with\nsolutions that are only locally optimal, making it challenging to find globally\noptimal ones. Moreover, these methods often use a single cost function to try\nto accomplish the two disparate goals of achieving a target gate and\nsuppressing noise, and this can lead to unnecessary tradeoffs between the two\nand, consequently, lower fidelities. Here, we present a method for designing\ndynamically corrected gates called B\\'ezier Ansatz for Robust Quantum (BARQ)\ncontrol to address these challenges. Rather than numerically optimizing the\ncontrols directly, BARQ instead makes use of the Space Curve Quantum Control\nformalism in which the quantum evolution is mapped to a geometric space curve.\nIn the formulation used by BARQ, the boundary conditions of the space curve\ndetermine the target gate, while its shape determines the noise robustness of\nthe corresponding gate. This allows the target gate to be fixed upfront, so\nthat numerical optimization is only needed to achieve noise-robustness, and\nthis is performed efficiently using a control-point parameterization of the\nspace curve.

The case of directional variables (taking\nvalues on (hyper)spheres) is given special attention.\n",

    "abstract": "  We present a comprehensive study of bar structures in the local Universe\nusing data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. Through isophotal analysis of\n232,142 galaxies, we identify bars and classify them into strong and weak\ncategories based on normalized bar length, using a threshold of 0.4. We find a\ntotal bar fraction of 42.9%, rising to 62.0% in disk galaxies, with strong\nbarred galaxies accounting for 30.0%. For barred galaxies in our sample,\ndeprojected bar lengths are measured both in absolute terms and normalized by\ngalaxy size. Most bars are found to have absolute lengths of 3-7 kpc, and\nnormalized bar lengths concentrated around a median value of 0.4. Bar\nellipticity mainly ranges from 0.2 to 0.6, with a median value of 0.3. Our\nanalysis reveals a bimodal distribution of bar fractions with respect to galaxy\ncolor, with weak bars in our classification being more prevalent in\nintermediate-color systems. With respect to stellar mass, strong bars also\npresent a bimodal distribution, while weak bars are distributed uniformly.\nNormalized bar length remains relatively stable across stellar masses, while\nabsolute bar length positively correlates with stellar mass. Cross-validation\nwith visual classifications from GZD catalog confirms a bar identification\naccuracy of 93%. These results validate our automated method for bar\nidentification and measurement, demonstrating its reliability. Our findings\nunderscore the importance of bars in galaxy evolution and highlight the\npotential of upcoming wide-field surveys to deepen our understanding of barred\ngalaxies.\n",

This paper introduces Lattice, a novel\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) mechanism that leverages the inherent low-rank\nstructure of K-V matrices to efficiently compress the cache into a fixed number\nof memory slots, achieving sub-quadratic complexity. We formulate this\ncompression as an online optimization problem and derive a dynamic memory\nupdate rule based on a single gradient descent step. The resulting recurrence\nfeatures a state- and input-dependent gating mechanism, offering an\ninterpretable memory update process. The core innovation is the orthogonal\nupdate: each memory slot is updated exclusively with information orthogonal to\nits current state hence incorporation of only novel, non-redundant data, which\nminimizes the interference with previously stored information. The experimental\nresults show that Lattice achieves the best perplexity compared to all\nbaselines across diverse context lengths, with performance improvement becoming\nmore pronounced as the context length increases.\n",

We propose in this\npaper a simple and flexible approach that gathers the advantages of both\nrepresentations by transforming MPs into autonomous systems. The key idea is to\ntransform the explicit representation of a trajectory as an implicit shape\nencoded as a distance field. This conversion from a time-dependent motion to a\nspatial representation enables the definition of an autonomous dynamical system\nwith modular reactions to perturbation.

This approach bridges\nconventional MPs with distance fields, ensuring smooth and precise motion\nencoding, while maintaining a continuous spatial representation.

In this paper, a proposed approach, iHHO-SMOTe, which addresses\nthe limitations of SMOTE by first cleansing the data from noise points. This\nprocess involves employing feature selection using a random forest to identify\nthe most valuable features, followed by applying the Density-Based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect outliers\nbased on the selected features. The identified outliers from the minority\nclasses are then removed, creating a refined dataset for subsequent\noversampling using the hybrid approach called iHHO-SMOTe. The comprehensive\nexperiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of\nthe proposed model, with an AUC score exceeding 0.99, a high G-means score of\n0.99 highlighting its robustness, and an outstanding F1-score consistently\nexceeding 0.967. These findings collectively establish Cleansed iHHO-SMOTe as a\nformidable contender in addressing imbalanced datasets, focusing on noise\nreduction and outlier handling for improved classification models.\n",

In the vast\nmajority of cases the main source of information will come from broad-band\nimages and data products thereof. Therefore, there is a pressing need to\nidentify or develop scalable yet reliable methodologies to estimate the\nredshift and physical properties of galaxies using broad-band photometry from\nEuclid, optionally including ground-based optical photometry also. To address\nthis need, we present a novel method to estimate the redshift, stellar mass,\nstar-formation rate, specific star-formation rate, E(B-V), and age of galaxies,\nusing mock Euclid and ground-based photometry. The main novelty of our\nproperty-estimation pipeline is its use of the CatBoost implementation of\ngradient-boosted regression-trees, together with chained regression and an\nintelligent, automatic optimization of the training data. The pipeline also\nincludes a computationally-efficient method to estimate prediction\nuncertainties, and, in the absence of ground-truth labels, provides accurate\npredictions for metrics of model performance up to z~2. We apply our pipeline\nto several datasets consisting of mock Euclid broad-band photometry and mock\nground-based ugriz photometry, to evaluate the performance of our methodology\nfor estimating the redshift and physical properties of galaxies detected in the\nEuclid Wide Survey. The quality of our photometric redshift and physical\nproperty estimates are highly competitive overall, validating our modeling\napproach. We find that the inclusion of ground-based optical photometry\nsignificantly improves the quality of the property estimation, highlighting the\nimportance of combining Euclid data with ancillary ground-based optical data.\n(Abridged)\n",

However, the interplay between their magnetic sublattices in\nconfined films remains poorly explored, particularly the coupling between 3d\nand 4f electrons. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of a 30 nm-thick\nthulium iron garnet (TmIG) thin film, where tensile strain promotes PMA.

In synthetic $^{12}$CO channel\nmaps, this results in brightness temperature differences within $\\pm1.5$ K in\nall our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's\nradial/azimuthal location with only a few % of scatter, with velocity\nperturbations varying $\\lesssim 20~\\%$ among the models.

To\naddress this, we here propose a comparative multi-planet approach: comparing\natmospheric compositions across multiple planets within a system to empirically\ndefine the 'abiotic baseline'. This baseline serves as a reference point for\nbiosignatures, and enables marginalisation over inaccessible, shared abiotic\nparameters. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by\ntheir birth in the same natal disk, having been irradiated by the same evolving\nstar, and having a related dynamical history. Observations aligning with the\nabiotic baseline, where the locally informed abiotic models demonstrate high\nout-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Deviations from\nthe baseline -- potentially biotic anomalies -- suggest an alternative origin.\nWe present the application of Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation to\nevaluate the performance of geochemical- and biogeochemical-climate models in\nexplaining these anomalies, using the expected log pointwise predictive density\nas a diagnostic. When biogeochemical models outperform their abiotic\ncounterparts, the anomaly may be shaped by life, and constitutes a comparative\nbiosignature. If both models perform poorly, the anomaly is flagged as an\n\"unknown unknown\" -- a signature of either unrecognised abiotic chemistry, or\nlife as we don't yet know it.\n",

However, their\napplication to structured data analysis remains fragile due to inconsistencies\nin schema interpretation, misalignment between user intent and model output,\nand limited mechanisms for self-correction when failures occur. This paper\nintroduces the STROT Framework (Structured Task Reasoning and Output\nTransformation), a method for structured prompting and feedback-driven\ntransformation logic generation aimed at improving the reliability and semantic\nalignment of LLM-based analytical workflows. STROT begins with lightweight\nschema introspection and sample-based field classification, enabling dynamic\ncontext construction that captures both the structure and statistical profile\nof the input data. This contextual information is embedded in structured\nprompts that guide the model toward generating task-specific, interpretable\noutputs. To address common failure modes in complex queries, STROT incorporates\na refinement mechanism in which the model iteratively revises its outputs based\non execution feedback and validation signals. Unlike conventional approaches\nthat rely on static prompts or single-shot inference, STROT treats the LLM as a\nreasoning agent embedded within a controlled analysis loop -- capable of\nadjusting its output trajectory through planning and correction. The result is\na robust and reproducible framework for reasoning over structured data with\nLLMs, applicable to diverse data exploration and analysis tasks where\ninterpretability, stability, and correctness are essential.\n",

The release of the homogeneous IUE final archive and the\navailability of the high-accuracy Hipparcos parallaxes provide an opportunity\nto revisit this issue, as accurate stellar distances make it possible to\ncompare observed absolute fluxes with the predictions of model atmospheres.\n  The near-UV continuum is highly sensitive to Teff and [Fe/H], and once the\ngravity is constrained from the parallax, these parameters may be derived from\nthe analysis of low-dispersion \"long-wavelength\" (2000-3000 A) IUE spectra for\nstars previously studied by Alonso et al. (1996; A&AS 117, 227) using the\nInfrared Flux Method (IRFM). A second comparison is carried out against the\nstars spectroscopically investigated by Gratton et al. (1996; A&A 314, 191). It\nis shown that there is a good agreement between Teffs obtained from the IRFM\nand from the near-UV continuum, and a remarkable correspondence between\nobserved and synthetic fluxes for stars with 4000 <= Teff <= 6000 K of any\nmetallicity and gravity. These facts suggest that model atmospheres provide an\nadequate description of the near-UV continuum forming region and that the\nopacities involved are essentially understood. For cooler stars, the results of\nthe IRFM are no longer reliable, as shown by Alonso et al., but the discrepancy\nnoticed for stars hotter than 6000 K may reflect problems in the model\natmospheres and/or the opacities at these higher temperatures.\n",

The field is rich in\ndifferent kinds of X-ray sources: point sources, supernova remnants (SNRs) and\ndiffuse X-ray emission from LMC interstellar gas. The observations are of\nunprecedented sensitivity, reaching a few 10^32 erg/s for point sources in the\nLMC. We describe how these data sets were analysed and discuss some of the\nspectroscopic results. For the SNR N157B the power law spectrum is clearly\nsteeper than previously determined from ROSAT and ASCA data. The existence of a\nsignificant thermal component is evident and suggests that N157B is not a\nCrab-like but a composite SNR. Most puzzling is the spectrum of the LMC hot\ninterstellar medium, which indicates a significant overabundance of Ne and Mg\nof a few times solar.\n",

Sinusoidal brightness variations with a\npeak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 0.25 mag are detected as function of\nposition angle, for both AGB and RGB stars. This is naturally interpreted as\nthe result of distance variations, due to one side of the LMC plane being\ncloser to us than the opposite side.

There is tentative\nevidence that the LMC disk plane may be warped.

In order to explore the\norigin of these subluminous stars, we evolved a set of low-mass stars from the\nmain sequence through the helium-core flash to the HB for a wide range in the\nmass loss along the red-giant branch (RGB). Stars with the largest mass loss\nevolve off the RGB to high effective temperatures before igniting helium in\ntheir cores. Our results indicate that the subluminous EHB stars, as well as\nthe gap within the EHB of NGC 2808, can be explained if these stars undergo a\nlate helium-core flash on the white-dwarf cooling curve. Under these conditions\nthe flash convection will penetrate into the stellar envelope, thereby mixing\nmost, if not all, of the envelope hydrogen into the hot helium- burning\ninterior. This phenomenon is analogous to the \"born-again\" scenario for\nproducing hydrogen-deficient stars during a very late helium-shell flash.\n\"Flash mixing\" greatly enhances the envelope helium and carbon abundances and,\nas a result, leads to an abrupt increase in the HB effective temperature. We\nargue that the EHB gap in NGC 2808 is caused by this theoretically predicted\ndichotomy in the HB morphology. Using new helium- and carbon-rich stellar\natmospheres, we show that the flash-mixed stars have the same reduced UV flux\nas the subluminous EHB stars. Moreover, we demonstrate that models without\nflash mixing lie, at most, ~0.1 mag below the EHB and hence fail to explain the\nobservations.

We offer here a more plausible\ninterpretation of their observation, in which the cold dust emission is\ngenerated by conducting needles with properties that are completely determined\nby the combined submillimeter and X-ray observations of the remnant. The\nneedles consist of metallic whiskers with <1% of embedded impurities that may\nhave condensed out of blobs of material that were expelled at high velocities\nfrom the inner metal-rich layers of the star in an asymmetric explosion. The\nneedles are collisionally heated by the shocked gas to a temperature of 8K.\nTaking the destruction of needles into account, a dust mass of only 1E-4 to\n1E-3M_sun is needed to account for the observed SCUBA emission. Aligned in the\nmagnetic field, needles may give rise to observable polarized emission. The\ndetection of submillimeter polarization will therefore offer definitive proof\nfor a needle origin for the cold dust emission.

In models of dusty winds,\nthe gas variables also adopt a power law dependence on radius.

Shortly thereafter, neutrinos drive a\nwind-like outflow from the neutron star. In both the convective bubble and the\nearly wind, weak interactions temporarily cause a proton excess (Ye > 0.5) to\ndevelop in the ejected matter. This situation lasts for at least the first\nsecond, and the approximately 0.05 - 0.1 solar masses that is ejected has an\nunusual composition that may be important for nucleosynthesis. Using tracer\nparticles to follow the conditions in a two-dimensional model of a successful\nsupernova explosion calculated by Janka, Buras & Rampp (2003), we determine the\ncomposition of this material. Most of it is helium and 56Ni. The rest is\nrelatively rare species produced by the decay of proton-rich isotopes unstable\nto positron emission. In the absence of pronounced charged-current neutrino\ncapture, nuclear flow will be held up by long-lived waiting point nuclei in the\nvicinity of 64Ge. The resulting abundance pattern can be modestly rich in a few\ninteresting rare isotopes like 45Sc, 49Ti, and 64Zn. The present calculations\nimply yields that, when compared with the production of major species in the\nrest of the supernova, are about those needed to account for the solar\nabundance of 45Sc and 49Ti. Since the synthesis will be nearly the same in\nstars of high and low metallicity, the primary production of these species may\nhave discernible signatures in the abundances of low metallicity stars.

The low-velocity peak is accounted for by the random motion\nof the single stars, while the high-velocity excess can be attributed to the\nlarge velocity changes produced by a significant fraction of unresolved\nbinaries in a cluster. We derive kinematic parameters of the single-star\ndistribution, in particular the projected velocity dispersion.

The astrospheric absorption is of particular\ninterest because it can be used to study solar-like stellar winds that are\notherwise undetectable. We find and analyze 33 HST Lyman-alpha spectra in the\narchive. All the spectra were taken with the E140M grating of the Space\nTelescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board HST. The HST/STIS\nspectra yield 4 new detections of heliospheric absorption (70 Oph, Xi Boo, 61\nVir, and HD 165185) and 7 new detections of astrospheric absorption (EV Lac, 70\nOph, Xi Boo, 61 Vir, Delta Eri, HD 128987, and DK UMa), doubling the previous\nnumber of heliospheric and astrospheric detections. When combined with previous\nresults, 10 of 17 lines of sight within 10 pc yield detections of astrospheric\nabsorption. This high detection fraction implies that most of the ISM within 10\npc must be at least partially neutral, since the presence of H I within the ISM\nsurrounding the observed star is necessary for an astrospheric detection. In\ncontrast, the detection percentage is only 9.7% (3 out of 31) for stars beyond\n10 pc. Our Lyman-alpha analyses provide measurements of ISM H I and D I column\ndensities for all 33 lines of sight, and we discuss some implications of these\nresults. Finally, we measure chromospheric Lyman-alpha fluxes from the observed\nstars. We use these fluxes to determine how Lyman-alpha flux correlates with\ncoronal X-ray and chromospheric Mg II emission, and we also study how\nLyman-alpha emission depends on stellar rotation.\n",

Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping\nby diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar\nformation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult.\nThis inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively.\nAssuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational\nconstraints, dwarfs with V_{peak} < 30 km/s can be completely stripped of their\ngas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with\nmore massive dark haloes and V_{peak} > 30 km/s lose most or all of their gas\ncontent only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially\ncounteracting the bar-driven inflow.

Cosmic mimicry is characterized by the\nfact that, at low redshifts, the Hubble parameter in the braneworld model is\nvirtually indistinguishable from that in the LCDM cosmology. An important point\nto note is that the \\Omega_m parameters in the braneworld model and in the LCDM\ncosmology can nevertheless be quite different. Thus, at high redshifts (early\ntimes), the braneworld asymptotically expands like a matter-dominated universe\nwith the value of \\Omega_m inferred from the observations of the local matter\ndensity. At low redshifts (late times), the braneworld model behaves almost\nexactly like the LCDM model but with a renormalized value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter \\Omega_m^{LCDM}. The redshift which characterizes cosmic\nmimicry is related to the parameters in the higher-dimensional braneworld\nLagrangian. Cosmic mimicry is a natural consequence of the scale-dependence of\ngravity in braneworld models. The change in the value of the cosmological\ndensity parameter is shown to be related to the spatial dependence of the\neffective gravitational constant in braneworld theory. A subclass of mimicry\nmodels lead to an older age of the universe and also predict a redshift of\nreionization which is lower than z_{reion} \\simeq 17 in the LCDM cosmology.\nThese models might therefore provide a background cosmology which is in better\nagreement both with the observed quasar abundance at z \\gsim 4 and with the\nlarge optical depth to reionization measured by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe.\n",

The nuclear\nluminosity and the nucleus-galaxy luminosity ratio of the high redshift BL Lacs\nare much larger than those in low redshift BL Lacs.

The\npredicted temperatures are changed to B-V colors using an adopted color\ntransformation. The predicted temperatures at the FBE become hotter as [Fe/H]\nchanges from 0 to -1.5, and thereafter cooler as the metallicity decreases to\n-2.5 and beyond. The temperature range over this interval of metallicity is\n$\\Delta$log $T_e$ = 0.04, or 640 K at 6900K. The predicted color variation is\nat the level of 0.03 mag in B-V. The predictions are compared with the observed\nRRL colors at the FBE for both the field and cluster variables, showing general\nagreement at the level of 0.02 mag in (B-V)$_o$, which, however, is the\nuncertainty of the reddening corrections.\n  The focus of the problem is then reversed by fitting a better envelope to the\nobserved FBE relation between color and metallicity for metallicities smaller\nthan -1.8 which, when inserted in the pulsation equation, gives a non-linear\ncalibration ....\n",

We study the influence of CRs on weakly magnetized relativistic\ncollisionless shocks and apply our results to external shocks in gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) afterglows. The common view is that the transverse Weibel\ninstability (TWI) generates a small-scale magnetic field that facilitates\ncollisional coupling and thermalization in the shock transition. The TWI field\nis expected to decay rapidly, over a finite number of proton plasma skin depths\nfrom the transition. However, the synchrotron emission in GRB afterglows\nsuggests that a strong and persistent magnetic field is present in the plasma\nthat crosses the shock; the origin of this field is a key open question. Here\nwe suggest that the common picture involving TWI demands revision. Namely, the\nCRs drive turbulence in the shock upstream on scales much larger than the skin\ndepth. This turbulence generates a large-scale magnetic field that quenches TWI\nand produces a magnetized shock. The new field efficiently confines CRs and\nenhances the acceleration efficiency. The CRs modify the shocks in GRB\nafterglows at least while they remain relativistic. The origin of the magnetic\nfield that gives rise to the synchrotron emission is plausibly in the CR-driven\nturbulence.

Comprehensive tests were performed to\nquantify sample incompleteness, as well as the rate of false positive CIV\nidentifications. The trend of constant $\\Omega_{CIV}(z)$ observed at z~2-5\nappears to continue to z~6, the highest observed redshift. The CIV sample is\nalso consistent with the redshift-invariant form of the CIV column density\ndistribution reported by Songaila (2001) at lower redshift, although with\nfairly large uncertainties due to a smaller sample size and noisier infrared\ndata. The constant value of $\\Omega_{CIV}$ does not necessarily imply that the\nIGM was infused with an early metallicity ``floor,'' but the presence of early\nCIV does indicate that heavy-element enrichment began < 1 Gyr after the Big\nBang. The lack of a decline in $\\Omega_{CIV}$ at high redshift may indicate\nthat integrated CIV measurements are sensitive to the instantaneous rate of\nfeedback from galaxy formation at each epoch. Alternatively, it could result\nfrom a balance in the evolution of the intergalactic gas density, ionization\nconditions, and heavy-element abundance over time.\n",

With the discovery of optical afterglows and counterparts to bursts\nin the last few years, enabling the determination of significant redshifts for\nthese sources, it is anticipated that profound spectral attenuation will arise\nin the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) energy band of 30 MeV-300\nGeV for many if not most bursts. This paper explores time-dependent\nexpectations for burst spectral properties in the EGRET/GLAST band, focusing on\nhow attenuation of photons by pair creation internal to the source generates\ndistinctive spectral signatures. The energy of spectral breaks and the\nassociated spectral indices provide valuable information that constrains the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the GRB outflow at a given time. Moreover, the distinct\ntemporal behavior that is present for internal attenuation is easily\ndistinguished from extrinsic absorption due to intervening cosmic background\nfields. These characteristics define palpable observational goals for both\nspaced-based hard gamma-ray experiments such as GLAST, and ground-based\nCherenkov telescopes, and strongly impact the observability of bursts above 300\nMeV.\n",

Early Chandra observations have shown that the most massive star\nsystem in the Orion Trapezium Cluster, theta2 Ori A, shows rapid variability on\ntime scales of hours. We determine X-ray fluxes and find that the star shows\nvery strong variability over the last 5 years. We observed a second large X-ray\noutburst in November 2004 with the high resolution transmission grating\nspectrometer on-board Chandra.

In the high state we find an extended emissivity\ndistribution with high emissivities in the range from 3 MK to over 100 MK. The\noutburst event in stellar terms is one of the most powerful ever observed and\nthe most energetic one in the ONC with a lower total energy limit of 1.5x10^37\nergs. The line diagnostics show that under the assumption that the line\nemitting regions in the low states are as close as within 1 -- 2 stellar radii\nfrom the O-star's photosphere, whereas the hard states suggest a distance of 3\n-- 5 stellar radii.

The radius of\nan alpha particle is calculated as an additional retrodictive test. In a third\nretrodictive test of the \"strong gravity\" hypothesis, the subatomic particle\nmass spectrum in the 100 MeV to 7,000 MeV range is retrodicted to a first\napproximation using the Kerr solution of General Relativity. The particle\nmasses appear to form a restricted set of quantized values of the Kerr\nsolution: n^1/2 M, where values of n are a set of discrete integers and M is\nthe revised Planck mass. The accuracy of the 27 retrodicted masses averages\n98.4%. Finally, the new atomic scale gravitational coupling constant suggests a\nradical revision of the assumptions governing the Planck scale, and leads to a\nnatural explanation for the fine structure constant.\n",

We have additionally incorporated cosmology, periodic\nboundary conditions with forces calculated using a quadrupole Ewald summation\nmethod, and radiative cooling and heating from a parameterized ionizing\nbackground following Katz, Weinberg & Hernquist (1996).

We explore here models based upon helium stars in the\nrange 9 - 14 Msun and carbon-oxygen stars 6 - 11 Msun which experience\nunusually energetic explosions (kinetic energy 0.5 - 2.8 x 10**52 erg).\nBolometric light curves and multi-band photometry are calculated and compared\nfavorably with observations. Both LTE and non-LTE spectra are also calculated\nfor the model that agrees best with the light curve, a carbon-oxygen core of 6\nMsun exploded with a kinetic energy of 2.2 x 10**52 erg. We also examine\npotential mechanisms for producing the observed gamma-ray burst (GRB) - shock\nbreak-out and relativistic shock deceleration in circumstellar material. For\nspherically symmetric models, both fail to produce a GRB of even the low\nluminosity inferred for GRB 980425. The high explosion energies required to\nunderstand the supernova are in contrast to what is expected for such massive\nstars and may indicate that a new sort of explosion has been identified,\npossibly the consequence of a collapsar (Woosley 1993, 1996). Indeed a more\nlikely explanation for what was seen is a highly asymmetric explosion in which\nthe GRB was produced by a relativistic jet, perhaps viewed obliquely, and only\na fraction of the total stellar mass was ejected, the remainder accreting into\na black hole. The ejected mass (but not the 56Ni mass), explosion energy, and\nvelocities may then be smaller. Other Type Ic supernova - GRB coincidences are\nsuggested.\n",

Recently\nthere has been increasing evidence that neutron stars possessing higher dipole\nspin-down fields do in fact exist, including a growing list of anomalous X-ray\npulsars (AXPs) with long periods and spinning down with high period\nderivatives, implying surface fields of $10^{14}$--$10^{15}$ Gauss.\nFurthermore, the recently reported X-ray period and period derivative for the\nSoft Gamma-ray Repeater (SGR) source SGR1806-20 suggest a surface field around\n$10^{15}$ Gauss. None of these high-field pulsars have yet been detected as\nradio pulsars. We propose that high-field pulsars should be radio-quiet because\nelectron-positron pair production in their magnetospheres, thought to be\nessential for radio emission, is efficiently suppressed in ultra-strong fields\n($B_0\\gtrsim 4\\times 10^{13}$ Gauss) by the action of photon splitting, a\nquantum electrodynamical process in which a photon splits into two. Our\ncomputed radio quiescence boundary in the radio pulsar $P-\\dot P$ diagram,\nwhere photon splitting overtakes pair creation, is located just above the\nboundary of the known radio pulsar population, neatly dividing them from the\nAXPs. We thus identify a physical mechanism that defines a new class of\nhigh-field radio-quiet neutron stars that should be detectable by their pulsed\nemission at X-ray and perhaps $\\gamma$-ray energies.\n",

We find a dominant old stellar population (aged ~7 Gyr), identifiable\nby the strong red giant branch (RGB) and red clump populations. From the (V-I)\ncolor of the RGB, we estimate a mean metallicity of the intermediate-age\nstellar population [Fe/H] = -1.38 +/- 0.31. We confirm a distance of 715 +/- 40\nkpc using the I-magnitude of the RGB tip. The main-sequence luminosity function\ndown to I ~25 provides evidence for a roughly constant SFR of approximately\n0.00035 solar masses per year across the WFPC2 field of view (0.22 square kpc)\nduring the past 250-350 Myr. Structure in the blue loop luminosity function\nimplies that the SFR was ~50% higher 400-900 Myr ago than today. The mean heavy\nelement abundance of these young stars is 1/10th solar. The best explanation\nfor a red spur on the main-sequence at I = 24.7 is the blue horizontal branch\ncomponent of a very old stellar population at the center of IC 1613. We have\nalso imaged a broader area of IC 1613 using the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope under\nexcellent seeing conditions. The AGB-star luminosity function is consistent\nwith a period of continuous star formation over at least the age range 2-10\nGyr. We present an approximate age-metallicity relation for IC 1613, which\nappears similar to that of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We compare the Hess\ndiagram of IC 1613 to similar data for three other Local Group dwarf galaxies,\nand find that it most closely resembles the nearby, transition-type dwarf\ngalaxy Pegasus (DDO 216).\n",

    "abstract": "  We have examined images from the Large Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph\n(LASCO) to study the relationship of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) to coronal\nstreamers. We wish to test the suggestion (Low 1996) that CMEs arise from flux\nropes embedded in a streamer erupting, thus disrupting the streamer. The data\nspan a period of two years near sunspot minimum through a period of increased\nactivity as sunspot numbers increased. We have used LASCO data from the C2\ncoronagraph which records Thomson scattered white light from coronal electrons\nat heights between 1.5 and 6R_sun. Maps of the coronal streamers have been\nconstructed from LASCO C2 observations at a height of 2.5R_sun at the east and\nwest limbs. We have superposed the corresponding positions of CMEs observed\nwith the C2 coronagraph onto the synoptic maps. We identified the different\nkinds of signatures CMEs leave on the streamer structure at this height\n(2.5R_sun). We find four types of CMEs with respect to their effect on\nstreamers:\n  1. CMEs that disrupt the streamer 2. CMEs that have no effect on the\nstreamer, even though they are related to it. 3. CMEs that create streamer-like\nstructures 4. CMEs that are latitudinally displaced from the streamer.\n  This is the most extensive observational study of the relation between CMEs\nand streamers to date. Previous studies using SMM data have made the general\nstatement that CMEs are mostly associated with streamers, and that they\nfrequently disrupt it. However, we find that approximately 35% of the observed\nCMEs bear no relation to the pre-existing streamer, while 46% have no effect on\nthe observed streamer, even though they appear to be related to it. Our\nconclusions thus differ considerably from those of previous studies.\n",

We trace the origin\nof the cosmological constant problem to the assumption that the local\ngravitational Newton constant $G$ (as measured in a Cavendish experiment) sets\nthe scale for global cosmology. And then we show that once this assumption is\nrelaxed, the very same cosmic acceleration which has served to make the\ncosmological constant problem so very severe can instead then serve to provide\nus with its potential resolution. In particular, we present an alternate\ncosmology, one based on conformal gravity, a theory whose effective\ncosmological $G_{eff}$ not only differs from the Cavendish one by being\naltogether smaller than it, but, by even being explicitly negative, naturally\nleads to cosmological repulsion. We show in the conformal theory, that once\ngiven only that the sign of $\\Lambda$ is specifically the negative one\nassociated with spontaneous scale symmetry breaking, then, that alone, no\nmatter how big $\\Lambda$ might actually be in magnitude, is sufficient to not\nonly make the actually measurable contribution $8\\pi G_{eff}\n\\Lambda/3cH^2(t_0)$ of $\\Lambda$ to current era cosmology naturally be of order\none today, but to even do so in a way which is fully compatible with the recent\nhigh $z$ supernovae cosmology data.

When the two oscillators are\nanharmonic, the amplitude dependence of their frequencies breaks, in general,\nany initial resonance so that no substantial energy transfer occurs unless an\nalmost perfect resonance persists. This paper considers this interesting\nsituation more generally between two discrete breathers (DBs) belonging to two\nweakly coupled nonlinear systems, finite or infinite. A specific amount of\nenergy injected as a DB in a nonlinear system (donor) which is weakly coupled\nto another nonlinear system (acceptor) sustaining another DB, might be totally\ntransferred and oscillate back and forth between these donor and acceptor DBs.\nThe condition is that a certain well defined detuning function is bounded from\nabove and below by two coupling functions. This targeted energy transfer (TET)\nis selective, i.e., it only occurs for an initial energy close to a specific\nvalue. The calculation of these functions in complex models with numerical\ntechniques developed earlier for DBs, allows one to detect the existence of\npossible TET, between which DBs and at which energy. It should also help for\ndesigning models having desired TET properties. We also show how extra linear\nresonances could make TET incomplete and irreversible. Developments of the\ntheory will be able to describe more spectacular effects, such as TET cascades\nand avalanches, and energy funnels. Besides rather short term applications for\ndevices, this theory might provide an essential clue for understanding puzzling\nproblems of energy kinetics in real materials, chemistry and bioenergetics.\n",

We show that, when one of the SC gaps is\nmuch larger than the others $|\\Delta_L| \\gg |\\Delta_R|$, the starting model can\nbe mapped exactly onto the single-channel model, which consists of the right\nlead of $\\Delta_R$ and the Anderson impurity with an extra onsite SC gap of\n$\\Delta_d \\equiv \\Gamma_L e^{i \\theta_L}$. Here $\\theta_L$ and $\\Gamma_L$ are\ndefined with respect to the starting model, and $\\Gamma_L$ is the level width\ndue to the coupling with the left lead. Based on this simplified model, we\nstudy the ground-state properties for the asymmetric gap, $|\\Delta_L| \\gg\n|\\Delta_R|$, using the numerical renormalization group (NRG) method. The\nresults show that the phase difference of the SC gaps $\\phi \\equiv \\theta_R\n-\\theta_L$, which induces the Josephson current, disturbs the screening of the\nlocal moment to destabilize the singlet ground state typical of the Kondo\nsystem. It can also drive the quantum phase transition to a magnetic doublet\nground state, and at the critical point the Josephson current shows a\ndiscontinuous change. The asymmetry of the two SC gaps causes a re-entrant\nmagnetic phase, in which the in-gap bound state lies close to the Fermi level.\n",

The intrinsic mechanism relates to a\ndc-field-induced transition process, or in other words, a linear stationary\nRabi process. The disorder-mediated one corresponds to a scattering between\nimpurities and the electrons participating in longitudinal transport.\nNumerically, the dependencies of the anomalous Hall conductivity on the\nspin-orbit coupling constants and the strength of the magnetization are\ndemonstrated for both the short- and long-range collisions.\n",

In complement to previous on-lattice Monte Carlo like\nstudies, we consider here off-lattice numerical calculations for large sequence\nlengths, relying on efficient algorithmic methods. We investigate finite size\neffects with the definition of an appropriate intrinsic length scale x,\ndepending on the parameters of the model. Based on the occurrence of large\nenough rare regions, for a given sequence length N, this study provides a\nqualitative picture for the finite size behavior, suggesting that the effect of\ndisorder could be sensed only with sequence lengths diverging exponentially\nwith x. We further look in detail at average quantities for the particular case\nx=1.3, ensuring through this parameter choice the correspondence between the\noff-lattice and the on-lattice studies. Taken together, the various results can\nbe cast in a coherent picture with a crossover between a nearly pure system\nlike behavior for small sizes N < 1000, as observed in the on-lattice\nsimulations, and the apparent asymptotic behavior indicative of disorder\nrelevance, with an (average) correlation length exponent \\nu_r >= 2/d (=2).\n",

However, the spectral compressibilities\nfound for the partial spectral segments and averaged over a whole relevant part\nof the spectrum cumulate close to a well-defined limit pertaining to the\nsemi-Poisson statistics. This is in accordance with similar tendencies revealed\nin the short-range averaged statistical characteristics of this model\ninvestigated in our previous paper [1]. We ascribe the nonuniversal and\ninhomogeneous nonintegrability behaviour to the changing degree of the\nbrokening of the rotation symmetry when changing parameters of our effectively\ntwo-dimensional model. It results in a random distribution of the respective\nlocalized wave functions at all scales up to the size of an available state\nspace. The multifractal behaviour of the wave functions is implied from the\nanalysis of their (averaged) fractal dimensions which range up to $1.5\\pm 0.1$\n(for $\\bar{D}_2$). This might imply the concept of the chaos-assisted\ntunnelling between the regions of reduced degree of stochasticity through\nregions of high degree of stochasticity. It supports the analogy with the\ntwo-dimensional Anderson model with marginal-asymptotically far metal-insulator\ntransition. The features found allow us to classify the present model as a\nmember of the class with a multifractal eigenfunction statistics characteristic\nfor the spectra with weakened level repulsion similar to the Anderson model\nclose to the metal-insulator transition.\n",

The model interpolates between the\nindependent dimer model and the S=1 spin chain by changing a strength of the\ndimerization. The energy gap is minimum at the fully-frustrated point, where a\nlocalized kink and a freely mobile anti-kink govern the low-lying excitations.\nAway from the point, a kink and an antikink form a bound state by an effective\ntriangular potential between them. The consequential gap enhancement and the\nlocalization length of the bound state is obtained exactly in the continuous\nlimit. The gap enhancement obeys a power law with exponent 2/3. The method and\nthe obtained results are common to other frustrated double spin-chain systems,\nsuch as the one-dimensional J_1 - J_2 model, or the frustrated ladder model.\n",

    "abstract": "  Since Val Tannen's pioneer work on the combination of simply-typed\nlambda-calculus and first-order rewriting (LICS'88), many authors have\ncontributed to this subject by extending it to richer typed lambda-calculi and\nrewriting paradigms, culminating in calculi like the Calculus of Algebraic\nConstructions. These works provide theoretical foundations for type-theoretic\nproof assistants where functions and predicates are defined by oriented\nhigher-order equations. This kind of definitions subsumes induction-based\ndefinitions, is easier to write and provides more automation. On the other\nhand, checking that user-defined rewrite rules are strongly normalizing and\nconfluent, and preserve the decidability of type-checking when combined with\nbeta-reduction, is more difficult. Most termination criteria rely on the term\nstructure. In a previous work, we extended to dependent types and higher-order\nrewriting, the notion of ``sized types'' studied by several authors in the\nsimpler framework of ML-like languages, and proved that it preserves strong\nnormalization. The main contribution of the present paper is twofold. First, we\nprove that, in the Calculus of Algebraic Constructions with size annotations,\nthe problems of type inference and type-checking are decidable, provided that\nthe sets of constraints generated by size annotations are satisfiable and admit\nmost general solutions. Second, we prove the later properties for a size\nalgebra rich enough for capturing usual induction-based definitions and much\nmore.\n",

In this paper we present the\nformalism for computing corrections to lensing observables for static,\nspherically symmetric gravity theories in which the corrections to the\nweak-deflection limit can be expanded as a Taylor series in one parameter,\nnamely the gravitational radius of the lens object. We take care to derive\ncoordinate-independent expressions and compute quantities that are directly\nobservable. We compute first- and second-order corrections to the image\npositions, magnifications, and time delays. Interestingly, we find that the\nfirst-order corrections to the total magnification and centroid position vanish\nin all gravity theories that agree with general relativity in the\nweak-deflection limit, but they can remain nonzero in modified theories that\ndisagree with GR in the weak-deflection limit. For the Reissner-Nordstrom\nmetric and a related metric from heterotic string theory, our formalism reveals\nan intriguing connection between lensing observables and the condition for\nhaving a naked singularity, which could provide an observational method for\ntesting the existence of such objects. We apply our formalism to the Galactic\nblack hole and predict that the corrections to the image positions are at the\nlevel of 10 micro-arcseconds, while the correction to the time delay is a few\nhundredths of a second. These corrections would be measurable today if a pulsar\nwere found to be lensed by the Galactic black hole; and they should be readily\ndetectable with planned missions like MAXIM.\n",

The theory\nbeing presented is obtained by adding to the BF action a Lagrange multiplier\nterm that enforces the constraint that the left handed and the right handed\nareas be equal. It is shown that Euclidean general relativity (GR) forms a\nsector of the resulting theory. The remaining three sectors of the theory are\nalso characterized and it is shown that, except in special cases, GR canonical\ninitial data is sufficient to specify the GR sector as well as a specific\nsolution within this sector.\n  Finally, the path integral quantization of the theory is discussed at a\nformal level and a hueristic argument is given suggesting that in the\nsemiclassical limit the path integral is dominated by solutions in one of the\nnon-GR sectors, which would mean that the theory quantized in this way is not a\nquantization of GR.\n",

The mass and\nwidth of known hyperons such as $\\Sigma^+$, $\\Sigma^-$ and $\\Lambda(1116)$ were\nused as a check of the mass determination accuracy and experimental resolution.\nApproximately 100,000 $\\Lambda^*(1520)$'s and 150,000 $\\phi$'s were observed in\nthe $\\bar K^0 K^+ n$ and $\\bar K^0 K^0 p$ final state respectively.

Upper limits were set on the production cross section of the reaction\n$\\gamma p \\to \\Theta^+ \\bar K^0$ as functions of center-of-mass angle, $nK^+$\nand $pK_S$ masses. Combining the results of the two reactions, the 95% C.L.\nupper limit on the total cross section for a resonance peaked at 1540 MeV was\nfound to be 0.7 nb. Within most of the available theoretical models, this\ncorresponds to an upper limit on the $\\Theta^+$ width, $\\Gamma_{\\Theta^{+}}$,\nranging between 0.01 and 7 MeV.\n",

Two studies have been conducted: in the\nfirst, we corroborrate previous per-event particle yields in Upsilon(1S)->ggg\nvs. e+e- -> qqbar. In the second, we compare particle production in the\nphoton-tagged process U(1S)->gggamma with that in e+e- -> qqbargamma events.\nFor each particle, we determine the `enhancement' ratio, defined as the ratio\nof particle yields per gluon fragmentation event compared to quark\nfragmentation event. Thus defined, an enhancement of 1.0 implies equal\nper-event production in both gluon and quark fragmentation. In the\nphoton-tagged analysis, we find an enhancement of order unity for protons and\napproximately 1.5 for lambda's. This measured proton enhancement rate is\nsupported by a study of baryon production in chib(J=2)->proton+X relative to\nchib(J=1)->proton+X. The production of mesons having masses of order 1 GeV (phi\nand f2(1270)) are found to be also approximately the same in gggamma vs.\nqqbargamma fragmentation. Overall, per-event baryon production in two-gluon\nfragmentation is considerably smaller than that observed in three-gluon decays\nof the Upsilon(1S). Our results for baryon production are inconsistent with the\npredictions of the JETSET (7.4) fragmentation model.\n",

We discover that preheating could be an important\nsource of adiabaticity where parametric resonance of the isocurvature\ncomponents amplifies the super-horizon fluctuations by a significant amount. As\nan example of these effects we develop a particle physics motivated model which\nwe recently introduced in which the D-flat direction is identified with the\nusual Higgs field. Our new results show that it is possible to achieve the\ncorrect curvature perturbations for initial values of the curvaton fields of\norder the weak scale. In this model we show that the prediction for the\nspectral index of the final curvature perturbation only depends on the mass of\nthe curvaton during inflation, where consistency with current observational\ndata requires the ratio of this mass to the Hubble constant to be < 0.3.\n",

The calculations have been performed for the\nmesons lying on linear trajectories in the $(n,M^2)$-planes, where $n$ is the\nradial quantum number. Our consideration relates to the $q\\bar q$ states with\none component in the flavor space, with the quark and antiquark masses equal to\neach other, such as $\\pi(0^{-+})$, $\\rho(1^{--})$, $\\omega(1^{--})$,\n$\\phi(1^{--})$, $a_0(0^{++})$, $a_1(1^{++})$, $a_2(2^{++})$, $b_1(1^{+-})$,\n$f_2(2^{++})$, $\\pi_2(2^{-+})$, $\\rho_3(3^{--})$, $\\omega_3(3^{--})$,\n$\\phi_3(3^{--})$, $\\pi_4(4^{-+})$ at $n\\le 6$. We obtained the wave functions\nand mass values of mesons lying on these trajectories. The corresponding\ntrajectories are linear, in agreement with data.

The contradiction originates in the fact that the\nstandard factorization assumption approximates the asymptotic final states by a\nnon-orthogonal set of states, thus leading to an overcounting of the decay\nprobability. We consider a system with two heavy quarks treated as classical\ncolor sources with constant velocity, and two mass-degenerate antiquarks.\nExploiting permutation symmetry in an adiabatic approximation, we find that\nfinal state interaction restores duality. Three $O(1/N_c)$ effects are\nexhibited: i) a proper treatment of orthogonality yields a global correction\n$1/N_c\\to 1/2N_c$ within a generalized factorization \\`a la BSW, (such a factor\nwas present in an Ansatz by Shifman), ii) the distorsion of the meson wave\nfunctions at the time of the weak decay, iii) relative phases generated by the\nlater evolution.

This method leads to\na systematic perturbative expansion to obtain the kinetic equations including\nhard-thermal loop resummation and to an improvement including renormalization,\noff-shell effects and contributions that change chemical equilibrium on short\ntime scales.

For Reissner-Nordstrom\nblack holes in d\\ge 4 dimensions, the exact worldsheet CFT is not known, but we\npropose that it has similar properties. We check that the leading order\nsolution is in good agreement with this proposal, and discuss the expected form\nof \\alpha' corrections.\n",

To investigate\nwhether a connection exists between both aspects of confinement, the spectrum\nof the Faddeev-Popov operator in two topological background fields is\ndetermined analytically in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. It is found that a single\ninstanton, which is likely irrelevant to quark confinement, also sustains only\nfew additional zero-modes.

We explain how the proposed theory manages to obey a number\nof tight constraints, two of which are constancy of the partition function and\nnoncriticality of the local density of states. An unexpected feature is the\nexistence of a truly marginal deformation, restricting the extent to which\nuniversality can hold in critical quantum Hall systems. The marginal coupling\nis fixed by matching the short-distance singularity of the conductance between\ntwo interior contacts to the classical conductivity sigma_xx = 1/2 of the\nChalker-Coddington network model. For this value, perturbation theory predicts\na critical exponent 2/pi for the typical point-contact conductance, in\nagreement with numerical simulations. The irrational exponent is tolerated by\nthe fact that the symmetry algebra of the field theory is Virasoro but not\naffine Lie algebraic.\n",

This amounts to precise\nways of handling the requisite additional structure encapsulating the various\ncoherence conditions. Given e. g. two augmented differential graded algebras A\nand B, an sh-map from A to B is a twisting cochain from the reduced bar\nconstruction of A to B and, in this manner, the class of morphisms of augmented\ndifferential graded algebras is extended to that of sh-morphisms. In the\npresent paper, we explore small models for equivariant (co)homology via\ndifferential homological algebra techniques including homological perturbation\ntheory which, in turn, is a standard tool to handle sh-structures.\n  Koszul duality, for a finite type exterior algebra on odd positive degree\ngenerators, then comes down to a duality between the category of sh-modules\nover that algebra and that of sh-comodules over its reduced bar construction.\nThis kind of duality relies on the extended functoriality of the differential\ngraded Tor-, Ext-, Cotor-, and Coext functors, extended to the appropriate\nsh-categories. We construct the small models as certain twisted tensor products\nand twisted Hom-objects. These are chain and cochain models for the chains and\ncochains on geometric bundles and are compatible with suitable additional\nstructure.\n",

As a result, it is of\ninterest to explore the feasibility of methods that dramatically reduce the\nnumber of paths measured in such situations while maintaining acceptable\naccuracy.\n  We cast the problem as one of statistical prediction--in the spirit of the\nso-called `kriging' problem in spatial statistics--and show that end-to-end\nnetwork properties may be accurately predicted in many cases using a\nsurprisingly small set of carefully chosen paths.

These patterns both arise as secondary states once the\nprimary hexagonal pattern becomes unstable. In one of these patterns (so-called\n`superlattice-II') the original hexagonal symmetry is broken in a subharmonic\ninstability to form a striped pattern with a spatial scale increased by a\nfactor of 2sqrt{3} from the original scale of the hexagons. In contrast, the\ntime-averaged pattern is periodic on a hexagonal lattice with an intermediate\nspatial scale (sqrt{3} larger than the original scale) and apparently has 60\ndegree rotation symmetry. We present a symmetry-based approach to the analysis\nof this bifurcation. Taking as our starting point only the observed\ninstantaneous symmetry of the superlattice-II pattern presented in [1] and the\nsubharmonic nature of the secondary instability, we show (a) that the\nsuperlattice-II pattern can bifurcate stably from standing hexagons; (b) that\nthe pattern has a spatio-temporal symmetry not reported in [1]; and (c) that\nthis spatio-temporal symmetry accounts for the intermediate spatial scale and\nhexagonal periodicity of the time-averaged pattern, but not for the apparent 60\ndegree rotation symmetry. The approach is based on general techniques that are\nreadily applied to other secondary instabilities of symmetric patterns, and\ndoes not rely on the primary pattern having small amplitude.\n",

Khrapko proposed a gauge noninvariant electrodynamics\nspin tensor (``Spin density of electromagnetic waves''). The standard\nelectrodynamics spin tensor is zero.\n  Here we point out that the Biot-Savarat formula uniquely results in a\npreferred, \"true\" vector potential field which is generated from a given\nmagnetic field. A similar integral formula uniquely permits to find a \"true\"\nscalar potential field generated from a given electric field even in the case\nof a nonpotential electric field.\n  A conception of differential forms is used. We say that an exterior\nderivative of a form is the boundary of this form and the integration of a form\nby the Biot-Savarat-type formula results in a new form named the generation.\nGenerating from a generation yields zero. The boundary of a boundary is zero. A\nboundary is closed. A generation is sterile. A conjugation is considered. The\nconjugation converts closed forms to sterile forms and back. It permits to\nconstruct chains of forms. The conjunction differs from the Hodge star\noperation: the conjugation does not imply the dualization.

This can\nalso be explained considering a time dependent scenario compatible with\nRelativity Principle, therefore supporting physical laws independent of the\ntime position of the observer. A theory considering such relativist scenario,\ni.e., generalizing Relativity Principle to position, embodies Cosmological\nPrinciple and can be intrinsically able to fit directly both local and cosmic\ndata. In part I it is presented the general framework of such a theory, called\nLocal Relativity (LR), and analysed the space-time structure. Special\nRelativity space-time is obtained, with no formal conflict with Einstein\nanalysis, but fully solving apparent paradoxes and conceptual difficulties,\nincluding the simultaneity concept and the long discussed Sagnac effect. In\npart II, LR is applied to positional analysis. It is verified the accordance\nwith solar system measurements and with classic cosmic tests, without dark\nmatter or dark energy. Two of the new features obtained in part II are the\npossibility of a planetary orbital evolution compatible with a null\ndetermination for G variation, supporting a warmer scenario for earth (and\nMars) past climate, and the possibility of an accelerating component in earth\nrotation, compatible with the most recent measurements.\n",

As the ratio approaches to\nunity, a clear resonance peak is observed, corresponding to the EMRA. Near the\nresonance regime, the strong magnetic fields still affect the electron\nacceleration dramatically. We derive an approximate analytical solution of the\nrelativistic electron energy in adiabatic limit, which provides a full\nunderstanding of this phenomenon.

In order to\nmeasure the effects of such perturbations, we introduce an appropriate global\nindex that selects events of high baroclinic activity and allows us to\nindividuate the phases of growth and decay of baroclinic waves. We then\ncomposite the tropopause mean structure before and after a baroclinic event,\nfinding that baroclinic disturbances cause the zonally averaged midlatitude\nwinter tropopause height to rise. Our results suggest that the baroclinic\nadjustment processes should be taken into account to explain the nature of the\nmidlatitude tropopause.\n",

    "abstract": "  The four-wave mixing produced with two ultrashort phase-locked w-3w laser\npulses propagating coherently in a two-level system in the infrared spectral\nregion is shown to depend on the pulses relative phase. The Maxwell-Bloch\nequations are solved beyond the rotating-wave approximation to account for\nfield frequencies which are largely detuned from the atomic resonance. The\nrelative phase dominating the efficiency of the coupling to the 5w anti-Stokes\nRaman component is determined by sign of the total ac Stark shift induced in\nthe system, in such a way that the phase influence disappears precisely where\nthe ac Stark effect due to both pulses is compensated. This fundamental quantum\ninterference effect can be the basis for nonlinear ultrafast optical\nspectroscopy techniques.\n",

A pair of ultracold spin-polarized $2^3S_1$ helium atoms is excited into\na molecular bound state in the purely long range $0_u^+$ potential connected to\nthe $2^3S_1 - 2^3P_0$ asymptote. The shift arises from the optical coupling of\nthe molecular excited bound state with the scattering states and the bound\nstates of two colliding $2^3S_1$ atoms. We measure the frequency-shifts for\nseveral ro-vibrational levels in the $0^+_u$ potential and find a linear\ndependence on the photoassociation laser intensity. Comparison with a\ntheoretical analysis provides a good indication for the s-wave scattering\nlength $a$ of the quintet ($^5\\Sigma_g^+$) potential, $a=7.2\\pm 0.6$ nm, which\nis significantly lower than most previous results obtained by non-spectroscopic\nmethods.\n",
