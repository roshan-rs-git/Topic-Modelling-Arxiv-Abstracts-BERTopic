# Topic-Modelling-Arxiv-Abstracts-BERTopic
This project analyzes 2.7M arXiv research papers by clustering their abstracts using BERTopic to uncover hidden thematic trends, while leveraging categories as labels for validation. The goal is to map the evolution of scientific topics and identify interdisciplinary connections in large-scale academic literature.
